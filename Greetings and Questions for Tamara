Dear Tamara,

It was so great to chat with you last time. This week I started my *Bloc* course and I found the **GitHub** was totally new to me, which was tricky.
I had several questions:
* I couldn't clone repo locally;
* I dind't how to test my work and watch the effect of Markdown;
* How could I delete my repositories?
* How to insert Image?
* As I opened http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com) with the Chrome browser, it warned me that the open resource was not safe. Did that matter or not?
* I didn't know several teminologies such as Syntax highlighting;
* How would we use markdown in our design project later? 

Best,

Dante
