# Three websites I like

## [Apple](http://www.apple.com)
  1. What problem is it trying to solve?
     * On the header, Categorize all their products for sale, offer supports and search function.
     * Showcase the most popular or foucsed product(Ipad Air 2 for now) on the main banner.
     * Introduce some featured services such as new computer system.
  2. Make a list of what you like about the site and explain why.
     * Clear layout for easily viewing and searching whatever user want, which is extremly understood by them: Grayscale for color
       scheme, clear and direct arrangement for all the buttons that are useful.
     * Crazy minimalism: Don't have anything redundant even such as drop-down box on the navigation bar.  
     * Unique search bar: different from some general ones.
  3. Make a list of what you do not like about the site and explain why.
     * One issue about inconsistency: the link closely below the showcase of iPad Air 2, 'Watch the keynote', direct users to the 
       page of 'Apple Event', which is not content-related.
  4. How would you fix those dislikes to make the site better?
     * Make another showcase for this apple event to make them a Carousel, or make it another image that is clickable as ones above
       the footer.
       
## [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com)
  1. What problem is it trying to solve?
     * Offer a community where users can connect, follow their focused people, share their feeling daily online, etc.
  2. Make a list of what you like about the site and explain why.
     * Accessibility: Display all the clickable links to make sure that users understand where they can click and enter the next page they 
       are interested in
     * The color of theme is pleased to see and the rationally arrangement of layout is easy to read: On the main content, it
       just has four components: 'Profile', 'Trends', 'Tweets' and 'Who to follow', which can be easily recoginized and understood by
       users.
     * Good idea to deal with the footer in 'infinite Scrollâ€™ design pattern: it avoid the disappear of footer by moving it to the bottom
       right corner area.
  3. Make a list of what you do not like about the site and explain why.
     * Repeat between Profile image on the main content area and one on the top right corner of the header.
     * When scroll down to some extent, there are no content on the both side of area of tweets, which is a little boring.
     * The unorganized footer(On the right hand now).
  4. How would you fix those dislikes to make the site better?
     * Change the image of profile on the header into more abstract thumnail
     * Add some hover box such as chatting with friends online
     * Add some vertical bar character "|" to device them and make them orgranized.

## [Google](http://www.google.com)
  1. What problem is it trying to solve?
     * Provide a searching function for users
     * Introduce some of their core and popular products or application such as Google+, Gmail and Image searching.
     * Promote their markting services such as social media.
  2. Make a list of what you like about the site and explain why.
     * Simplistic sytle, pleasant to see: mainly from white and gray
     * Clear layout: less buttons but achieve several imporant controls such as search function or some core products or service
       from Google.
     * Interesting contorl: the image above the seraching box introduce what happened today or how events or people have someth-
      ing to do with today's date in history & The button 'I am feeling lukcy' direct users to some specific pages that is rela-
      tive to the outcome of roll-up.
  3. Make a list of what you do not like about the site and explain why.
     * It is not so easy for users to totally understand what the button ''I am feeling lukcy' is meant to and used for.
  4. How would you fix those dislikes to make the site better?
     * Make a hover to introduce the intention more clear, or make room for introduction in the next page after users clicked
       button.
