Dear Tamara,

From Checkpoint 3, I have learned and reviewed UX design, UCD design, and some Key patterns that lead me to better pattern when I am designing my app.
Actually I think it is very helpful and practical. However, I also have several questions as showend on the question page.

Thank you,

Dante
