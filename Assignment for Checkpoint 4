## Logo's color palette

- **Scenario 1: #363940, #676D75, #9DB0AF, #C6D6D9, #EEF6FF
  * I choose this palatte from Adobe Kuler. And I think the logo from Jott.ly should be very modern and professional. So I kind of 
  refer to Apple's webside, which is just full of grayscale color. So I just want to make the logo pleasant to watch and choose a 
  palette that has several scales of gray and low lightness color such as green-gray.
  
  **Scenario 2: Pure White
  * Like you recommend before, I have learned some good website in this link: [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com/templates/?q=peak)
  So I think we may wanna just keep the logo pure white in this website, which is also nice to see.
  
  Thank you,
