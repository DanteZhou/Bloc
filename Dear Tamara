Dear Tamara,

It was so great to chat with you last time. This week I started my *Bloc* course and I found the **GitHub** was totally new to me, which was tricky.
I had several questions to ask you:
* I couldn't clone repo locally
* I dind't how to test my work and watch the effect of Markdown.
* How would we use markdown in our design project later?

Best,

Dante
